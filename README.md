## Usage

This section explains how to use this project.

```sh
bin/create-authority-certificates.sh
```

Create node encryption keys and certificates. Requires authority certificates first.

```sh
bin/create-node-certificate.sh ldap
```

Check that a server has a valid private key. This is the main use case of SSL.

```sh
bin/check-server-certificate.sh ldap.example.org /tmp/ca_certs.pem
```

Check that an issued certificate was signed by a specific instance.

```sh
bin/check-issued-certificate.sh private/example.org.authority-certificate.crt private/example.org.intermediate-certificate.crt
bin/check-issued-certificate.sh private/example.org.intermediate-certificate.crt private/ldap.example.org.intermediate-certificate.crt
```

Show certificate information.

```sh
bin/show-certificate-info.sh private/example.org.authority-certificate.crt
bin/show-certificate-info.sh private/example.org.intermediate-certificate.crt
bin/show-certificate-info.sh private/ldap.example.org.node-certificate.crt
```

Show private key information.

```sh
bin/show-key-info.sh private/example.org.authority-private-key.pem
bin/show-key-info.sh private/example.org.intermediate-private-key.pem
bin/show-key-info.sh private/ldap.example.org.node-private-key.pem
```
